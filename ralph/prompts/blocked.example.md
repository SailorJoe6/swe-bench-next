Study the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, features, and configuration
2. **[DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)** - Build setup, development workflow, and testing
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation index and navigation

Run `bd prime` to understand our beads workflow.

Read the files in `ralph/plans/blocked`.  Explain to the user why the Agent marked the project as blocked.  Work with the user to get the project unblocked.  If the user sucessfully unblocks the project for you, then move both ralph/plans/blocked/EXECUTION_PLAN.md and ralph/plans/blocked/SPECIFICATION.md out of ralph/plans/blocked and back to ralph/plans/.
