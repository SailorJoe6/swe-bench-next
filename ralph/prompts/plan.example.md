Study the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, features, and configuration
2. **[DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)** - Build setup, development workflow, and testing
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation index and navigation

After you have studied those files, study the [spec doc](ralph/plans/SPECIFICATION.md) for the changes we are currently working on.  Then, audit the current status of the project against this spec to determine what work needs to be done.  Work with me to develop a new document `ralph/plans/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.  This will hold your plan of action for implementing the spec.
