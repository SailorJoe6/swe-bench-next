Prepare to hand off your work. A new programmer is going to be taking over. The new programmer won't have any context other than any specs and plans we've been working with, the beads issues and their own ability to inspect the project. So, ensure your docs and beads issues have all the context the new programmer will need to pick up where you left off. Don't rely on beads comments alone. Ensure the issue's content contain the right information for the programmer to pick up where you left off. If you've learned things that need to go in the spec or plans, then update them accordingly. Don't create any new handoff docs, just update the spec, plan and/or beads. Keep in mind our golden rule of thumb for documentation: Don't Repeat Yourself. Specs and planning docs are for high level design and plans, beads issues are for current focus, status and tasks. Keep both detailed but concise. Avoid fluff and repetition.

When reporting the handoff, output only the following sections:
- Status
- Evidence (file/line, log name, command output, or other artifact)
- Next Step
- Beads Update

Do not include narrative summaries or restate plan/spec content. Once you are ready to hand off, let me know and await further instructions.
