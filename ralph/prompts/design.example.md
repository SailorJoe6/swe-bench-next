Study the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, features, and configuration
2. **[DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)** - Build setup, development workflow, and testing
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation index and navigation

Now, I want to discuss with you some work we need to do on to this project.  I don't want you to start work on it, I just want to have a conversation with you about it.  Ask me questions about the job to be done, ask your questions one at a time so as not to overwhelm me.  

When you think you have enough information to describe the work to be done as a detailed spec, create a file `ralph/plans/SPECIFICATION.md`.  Document everything about the work to be done in `ralph/plans/SPECIFICATION.md` in a manner that is both clear and concise.  Be as thorough and detailed as necessary, but avoid fluff and repetition.  Focus on a description of the system as it is now, how it must change and how it will be when the work is done.  This is not a detailed execution plan, that will come later.  This is a specification of the work to be done.
