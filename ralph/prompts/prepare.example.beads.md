Study the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, features, and configuration
2. **[DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)** - Build setup, development workflow, and testing
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation index and navigation

Check if there are any markdown docs in the `ralph/plans/` folder, study these as well.  Don't recurse subfolders!  Only study markdown docs directly in the `ralph/plans/` folder.  

Finally run `bd prime` to understand our beads workflow.
